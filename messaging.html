                        As part of a final project for my Computer Networks course I, 
                        working with a partner, was tasked to create an instant messenger using
                        a client server model. The program was written in C and uses Socket programming to handle connection of clients to the server.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The program was designed with two types of clients that connect to the server. 
                        The first of the two is the observer client which receives and displays a stream of messages from the server in real-time.
                        The second type of client is aparticipant.  Participantâ€™s primary job is to send messages.  The server supports up to 255 participants, and an equal number of observers.
