                            For a term project in a Mobile Programming course, <br>
                            I along with two partners made an android application <br>
                            that aims to have a fully customizable recipe book on your phone, <br>
                             while also providing extra functionality beyond that offered by other apps.<br>                         
                            <br>
                            Users can also upload their recipes, allowing others to view and download them. <br>
                            All recipes can be given tags such as “quick”, “breakfast”, “vegetarian”, etc. <br>
                            that users can use to both search for new recipes on the server and to navigate <br>
                            through the recipes they have stored on their phone. Each recipe is stored as an object<br>
                            that has data such as a title, ingredients, etc. When looking at a recipe, users <br>
                            can check off ingredients that they have enough of. <br>
                            <br>
                            For this project I contributed the local and servside database system that<br>
                            allowed users to download edit and share recipes. I implemented this using<br>
                            Google Firbase's realtime database system and stored recipes as JSON objects<br>
                            to easily transfer objects back and forth between Firebase and a locally <br>
                            stored SQLite database that holds users downloaded and created recipes.<br>  
                            <br>
