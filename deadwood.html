                        As part of a final project for my Object Oriented Design course I, 
                        was tasked to recreate the boardgame Deadwood Studios in Java using 
                        a model view controller (MVC) program design. This project gave me the chance
                        to learn about planning and designing an application from the ground up.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The project began with me planning the design of the model using UML
                        design protocols. In doing this I constructed UML class diagrams to plan the structure and class hierarchy
                        of the program as well as enumerated use cases to test my model against. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I then implemented the model which was playable using the 
                        command line in which it would take user input and parse that into player turn commands.
                        After this I created the view and controller which utilized java's AWT and Swing libraries to provide
                        the GUI. This was my first time implementing UI in Java and it taught me a lot about UI and event programming.
